          Our journey began at 5 am from Oberoi Mall, with Shubham riding with
          one pillion. We opted to have breakfast after sunrise. Harihareshwar,
          a tranquil coastal village in Maharashtra, awaited us.
        </li>
        <li>
          Despite the early start, we reached Harihareshwar by 1 pm. After
          darshan at the Mahadev Temple, we explored the beach nestled within a
          valley, enjoying the mesmerizing rock formations shaped by the sea
          waves. We relaxed, took photos, and indulged in the serene atmosphere.
          After climbing back up, we refreshed with nimbu pani and impulsively
          booked a RO-RO ferry from Alibag to Mumbai. Feeling fatigued, we
          agreed that one-day rides weren't ideal. Despite this, we reached the
          ferry early, enjoying the moonlit sea views on the top level.
          Following dinner in Goregaon West, we parted ways, concluding our
          ride.
        </li>
        <li>
          We also decided to uphold a tradition of visiting a Mahadev temple on
          every ride, a tradition we've continued to follow since. <br />
          During the ride, we encountered numerous breathtaking views and
          picturesque river crossings. We unanimously agree that this journey
          stands out as one of the most scenic rides we've experienced to date.
