        Our journey began at 5 am from Oberoi Mall, with Shubham riding with one
        pillion. We opted to have breakfast after sunrise. Harihareshwar, a
        tranquil coastal village in Maharashtra, awaited us.
        <br />
        Despite the early start, we reached Harihareshwar by 1 pm. After darshan
        at the Mahadev Temple, we explored the beach nestled within a valley,
        enjoying the mesmerizing rock formations shaped by the sea waves. We
        relaxed, took photos, and indulged in the serene atmosphere. After
        climbing back up, we refreshed with nimbu pani and impulsively booked a
        RO-RO ferry from Alibag to Mumbai. Feeling fatigued, we agreed that
        one-day rides weren't ideal. Despite this, we reached the ferry early,
        enjoying the moonlit sea views on the top level. Following dinner in
        Goregaon West, we parted ways, concluding our ride. <br />
        We also decided to uphold a tradition of visiting a Mahadev temple on
        every ride, a tradition we've continued to follow since. <br />
        During the ride, we encountered numerous breathtaking views and
        picturesque river crossings. We unanimously agree that this journey
        stands out as one of the most scenic rides we've experienced to date.
