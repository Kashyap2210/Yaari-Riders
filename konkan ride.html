        Certainly! Here's the revised version with <br />
        tags added at the end of each paragraph: The Konkan ride of 2023 stands
        out as the longest and toughest journey our group has tackled so far. We
        kicked off our adventure from Oberoi Mall, aiming to reach Ganpatiphule
        by 2 pm on day one. However, multiple bike issues and poor road
        conditions meant we were only halfway there by 1 pm. Despite starting at
        4:30 am, we only reached Kalamboli by 8 am, far behind schedule. After a
        slow journey on the Mumbai-Goa highway, we arrived in Kolad by 1:30 pm,
        with our average speed severely affected by the bad roads.<br />

        After lunch, we aimed to reach Ganpatiphule before sunset, but we
        arrived just after, still able to enjoy the beach's view. We checked
        into our hotel, had dinner, and took a leisurely stroll in
        Ganpatiphule's calm weather before calling it a day.<br />

        The next morning, we visited the Ganpatiphule temple and explored the
        local market and beach. However, the urgency to visit Marleshwar temple
        and reach Kolhapur by night loomed over us. After swiftly returning to
        the hotel to pack, we left for Marleshwar, arriving by 12 pm.<br />

        Marleshwar, a hilltop Mahadev temple with a cave entrance and nearby
        waterfall, was mesmerizing. We left for Kolhapur at 2:30 pm, arriving at
        our villa by 8 pm. After freshening up, we visited Mata Laxmi temple,
        enjoyed dinner, and did some shopping before calling it a night.<br />

        The following morning, we washed our bikes before departing for Pune
        from Kolhapur. Surprisingly, the roads on day two were much smoother,
        allowing us to reach Pune from Kolhapur in record time. Despite a brief
        delay in Lonavala due to traffic, we reached Mumbai by 5 pm, concluding
        our Konkan 2023 adventure. As we parked our bikes one last time, we
        reflected on the lessons learned - always respect the roads, no matter
        how skilled you think you are.<br />
