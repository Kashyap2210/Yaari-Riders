          The Konkan ride of 2023 stands out as the longest and toughest journey
          our group has tackled so far. We kicked off our adventure from Oberoi
          Mall, aiming to reach Ganpatiphule by 2 pm on day one. However,
          multiple bike issues and poor road conditions meant we were only
          halfway there by 1 pm. Despite starting at 4:30 am, we only reached
          Kalamboli by 8 am, far behind schedule. After a slow journey on the
          Mumbai-Goa highway, we arrived in Kolad by 1:30 pm, with our average
          speed severely affected by the bad roads.

          After lunch, we aimed to reach Ganpatiphule before sunset, but we
          arrived just after, still able to enjoy the beach's view. We checked
          into our hotel, had dinner, and took a leisurely stroll in
          Ganpatiphule's calm weather before calling it a day.

          The next morning, we visited the Ganpatiphule temple and explored the
          local market and beach. However, the urgency to visit Marleshwar
          temple and reach Kolhapur by night loomed over us. After swiftly
          returning to the hotel to pack, we left for Marleshwar, arriving by 12
          pm.

          Marleshwar, a hilltop Mahadev temple with a cave entrance and nearby
          waterfall, was mesmerizing. We left for Kolhapur at 2:30 pm, arriving
          at our villa by 8 pm. After freshening up, we visited Mata Laxmi
          temple, enjoyed dinner, and did some shopping before calling it a
          night.
        </li>

          The following morning, we washed our bikes before departing for Pune
          from Kolhapur. Surprisingly, the roads on day two were much smoother,
          allowing us to reach Pune from Kolhapur in record time. Despite a
          brief delay in Lonavala due to traffic, we reached Mumbai by 5 pm,
          concluding our Konkan 2023 adventure. As we parked our bikes one last
          time, we reflected on the lessons learned - always respect the roads,
          no matter how skilled you think you are.
