          Bhimashankar Ride: This ride stands out as one of the smoothest
          journeys we've had, despite encountering some hiccups along the way.
          Beginning our journey from Oberoi Mall, we faced a minor setback early
          on as four of our riders veered off onto different roads, delaying our
          progress by an hour. Nonetheless, we regrouped at Vashi toll and
          continued our journey as planned.

          Most aspects of this trip went according to our preplanned itinerary,
          including a refreshing breakfast stop at Rangoli Hotel. While en route
          to Bhimashankar, some of us split up due to varying speeds of our
          bikes, but the majority stayed together, covering miles until we
          reached our destination by 1 pm and checked into the Natraj Holiday
          Resort.

          After a satisfying lunch at the hotel, we set out to explore Hanuman
          Lake and Mata Anjani Temple. Along the way, we encountered a baba who
          suggested a short trek to the hilltop, which we assumed to be Gupt
          Bhimashankar. Despite reaching the top, we realized it was Nagphani,
          not Gupt Bhimashankar, but the panoramic views and photoshoot made it
          worthwhile. Returning to the hotel, we struggled to find a dinner spot
          nearby and opted to dine in. The evening concluded with engaging
          conversations about our riding experiences and life before retiring
          for the night.

          The following morning, we woke up early to attend the Morning Aarti at
          Bhimashankar Jyotirlinga Temple, experiencing the serene atmosphere
          and powerful energy. After a fulfilling darshan inside the garbh-grih,
          we embarked on a trek to Gupt Bhimashankar, a scenic 3 km journey
          through the jungles. The sight of five Shivlings surrounded by a small
          waterfall was truly enchanting, reinforcing the significance of this
          spot on our trip. After darshan at Gupt Bhimashankar, we returned to
          the hotel and departed by 11:45 am.

          The return journey was eventful, with everyone eventually regrouping
          and riding in formation up to the Mumbai-Pune highway. Following a
          two-hour drive, we stopped for lunch at Vivotree Hotel. Continuing our
          journey towards Mumbai, one of our riders took a wrong turn, leading
          to a brief separation. However, we reunited and decided to halt in
          Malad East for a commemorative photo, marking the end of our ride.
          This ride was not only complete but also a valuable learning
          experience, providing us with lessons that will undoubtedly enhance
          our future journeys.
