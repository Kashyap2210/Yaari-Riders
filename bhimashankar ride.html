        Bhimashankar Ride: This ride stands out as one of the smoothest journeys
        we've had, despite encountering some hiccups along the way. Beginning
        our journey from Oberoi Mall, we faced a minor setback early on as four
        of our riders veered off onto different roads, delaying our progress by
        an hour. Nonetheless, we regrouped at Vashi toll and continued our
        journey as planned. Most aspects of this trip went according to our
        preplanned itinerary, including a refreshing breakfast stop at Rangoli
        Hotel. While en route to Bhimashankar, some of us split up due to
        varying speeds of our bikes, but the majority stayed together, covering
        miles until we reached our destination by 1 pm and checked into the
        Natraj Holiday Resort. After a satisfying lunch at the hotel, we set out
        to explore Hanuman Lake and Mata Anjani Temple. Along the way, we
        encountered a baba who suggested a short trek to the hilltop, which we
        assumed to be Gupt Bhimashankar. Despite reaching the top, we realized
        it was Nagphani, not Gupt Bhimashankar, but the panoramic views and
        photoshoot made it worthwhile. Returning to the hotel, we struggled to
        find a dinner spot nearby and opted to dine in. The evening concluded
        with engaging conversations about our riding experiences and life before
        retiring for the night. The following morning, we woke up early to
        attend the Morning Aarti at Bhimashankar Jyotirlinga Temple,
        experiencing the serene atmosphere and powerful energy. After a
        fulfilling darshan inside the garbh-grih, we embarked on a trek to Gupt
        Bhimashankar, a scenic 3 km journey through the jungles. The sight of
        five Shivlings surrounded by a small waterfall was truly enchanting,
        reinforcing the significance of this spot on our trip. After darshan at
        Gupt Bhimashankar, we returned to the hotel and departed by 11:45 am.
        The return journey was eventful, with everyone eventually regrouping and
        riding in formation up to the Mumbai-Pune highway. Following a two-hour
        drive, we stopped for lunch at Vivotree Hotel. Continuing our journey
        towards Mumbai, one of our riders took a wrong turn, leading to a brief
        separation. However, we reunited and decided to halt in Malad East for a
        commemorative photo, marking the end of our ride. This ride was not only
        complete but also a valuable learning experience, providing us with
        lessons that will undoubtedly enhance our future journeys.
