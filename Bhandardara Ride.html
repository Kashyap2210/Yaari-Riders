      <h1>Bhandardara Ride: Where Our Adventure Began</h1>

          The Bhandardara Ride marked the inaugural journey for our group,
          laying the foundation for what would become the Yaari Riders. It was a
          collective first for most of us, and our lack of experience quickly
          became apparent. Despite being ill-prepared with inadequate rain gear
          and mostly stock bikes, we pushed forward undeterred, braving the
          soaking rain along Ghodbunder road. Navigating the highways proved
          challenging, with numerous rough patches slowing our progress.
          Departing at 4:30 am from National Park, we finally arrived at
          Bhandardara Dam by 1 pm, a grueling 8.5-hour journey. A fortunate stop
          at a roadside hotel provided us with a hearty breakfast, a stroke of
          luck as we later discovered a scarcity of eateries near our
          destination. In fact, upon arrival, we found only a solitary stall
          within a 3-kilometer.

          After enjoying the dam, taking lots of photos, and feeling happy about
          completing our first ride successfully (even though some of us fell
          but quickly got back up), we all gathered at the food stall and ate
          almost everything. Then, we decided to start our journey back at 2:30
          PM.

          As we began our return journey, we encountered light rain near the
          dam, but it seemed like the roads we came from had endured heavy
          rainfall, leaving them filled with potholes. Despite the slight rain,
          the conditions made us completely drenched. It took us nearly an hour
          to traverse just 15 kilometers of rough terrain before connecting to
          the state highway. After overcoming these challenges, we stumbled upon
          a welcoming restaurant where we intended to grab a quick refreshment
          break. However, what was meant to be a brief stop turned into a
          leisurely lunch break lasting an hour and a half. By the time we
          resumed our journey, it was nearing 4 PM, with many of us riding with
          passengers. With the evening approaching, we aimed to cover as much
          distance as possible before darkness fell, planning to regroup once
          night descended.
