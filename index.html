        <h2>Yaari Riders</h2>
        <p>
          Our riding group is mostly made up of young riders who are new to
          riding. We don't have any rules about the size of the motorcycle
          engines, and we don't have founders, just brothers. Everyone is
          welcome to join us. We're all about being friendly and supportive. It
          doesn't matter if you're a beginner or more experienced, you can be
          part of our group. We're all about coming together, enjoying riding,
          and having fun. We share our adventures and love for motorcycles,
          making us feel like one big family.
